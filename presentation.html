# Choose your weapon (blaster or lightsaber?)

---

One of my favorite things about JavaScript is that it isn't dependent upon a specific operating system. Meaning -- anyone can learn it. Whether you're a farmer from Tattooine, or a rogue Princess, or even a scruffy-looking nerfherder.

That said, there are some tools you do need:

* A text editor (or IDE)
* A browser

---

I use Google Chrome, because I really like the dev tools. I use Atom for my text editor because it's free and works well on my Mac.

---

And really those are the only two things you need to get started. That and lots of practice and patience.

Of course there's a huge variety of other tools out there that you can use as well.

---

# Libraries

---

There are loads and loads of libraries out there. You can be old school and go with jQuery, or you can be fancy and go with a newer framework like Angular.

---

# Beware of the Dark side

---

Libraries and Frameworks are really great in that they have loads of shortcuts and make things a lot easier on you. You get your stuff out faster with less frustration, so it sounds good all around, right?

???

---

The problem with using libraries early on is that you don't really understand what is making your code work. There's nothing wrong with using a library to help you do something faster or easier, but if you don't have a firm grasp of the basics, you won't know where to start for debugging.

---

???
Again, not saying don't EVER use a library/framework, just use your judgement.

# Trust your feelings

---

When am I ready to start learning something new?

Ie. Library, Framework, new language, etc.

???
Unfortunately no one can really answer this question for you. But I do have a good rule of thumb that works well for me.

---

Could you complete the task without the library/framework?

Do you understand how to do this in the first language you learned?

Do you understand what you are doing without the library/framework?

???
If you answer yes to these questions, you are probably fine using a library/framework and/or learning something new.
At this point I'd like to switch gears and talk about doing work to benefit your community.

---

When am I ready to start on a project?

???
This one is a lot easier to answer....you're ready now.
It's never too early to start planning and practicing on something that is important to you...especially if it benefits others!

---

Think about things that really matter to you...

???
Here's a few examples of different things that use JavaScript (because JavaScript is awesome!)

---

# Education

---

* (Khan Academy Exercises)[https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises]
* (Quill)[https://github.com/empirical-org/Empirical-Core]

???
You're probably familiar with Khan Academy providing free video lessons to students on a variety of subjects. They're pretty cool and I've used them myself. This specific framework is available to build exercises and can be used independently of the Khan Academy application.

Quill is another free tool for students that assists them with writing and proof reading.

---

# Poverty

---

* (Sheltr Web Application)[https://github.com/sheltr/sheltr]

???
A mobile-friend web application that is local to Philadelphia. This application allows a person to enter a local address and find a nearby homeless shelter.

---

# Healthcare

---

* (OpenLMIS)[https://github.com/OpenLMIS/open-lmis]

???
A system that works with under-developed countries to help make medicines and other healthcare supplies available (double check this)

---

# Victim Assistance

---

* (Predator Alert Tool)[https://github.com/meitar/pat-facebook]

???
Might remove this one

---

# Activism

---

* (ActivateHub)[https://github.com/activate/ActivateHub]

???
This site features a few cities, but allows the addition of more. Includes information such as community events, discussions and more. Data is on a calendar that can be downloaded to iCalendar, or subscribed to.

---

# Civic Engagement

---

* (Denver Street Sweeping)[https://github.com/codeforamerica/denver-schedules]

???
This is a Code For America project that allows a person to enter their address and receive email or text alerts regarding upcoming streetsweeps. This helps keep people from getting tickets or their car towed.
